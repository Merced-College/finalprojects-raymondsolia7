// Final Project

I used upto and including 40 lines of java code for a "Calculator app" .


Per "Libguides" I sourced copilot and youtube for ideas and functionality's.


I'll use this README. txt file instead of flowchart to simplify efforts.


I encountered errors on the problem workbench tab specifying the app not being able to be visible.


Via Eclipse as the IDE.


The duration of the app usage depends on the user's discreation.


Intended fuctions are addition,subtraction,division,multiplication etc..
